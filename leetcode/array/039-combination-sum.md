Given a **set **of candidate numbers \(**C**\)**\(without duplicates\)**and a target number \(**T**\), find all unique combinations in **C **where the candidate numbers sums to**T**.

The **same **repeated number may be chosen from **C **unlimited number of times.

**Note:**

* All numbers \(including target\) will be positive integers.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example:**

```
Given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 
A solution set is: 
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
```
